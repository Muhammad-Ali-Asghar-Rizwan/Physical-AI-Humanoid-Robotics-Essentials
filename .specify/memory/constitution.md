# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Clarity
Content must progress systematically from beginner to advanced concepts, ensuring accessibility for learners at all levels. All explanations should be clear, well-structured, and pedagogically sound, moving from fundamental concepts to complex implementations with appropriate scaffolding.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All content related to AI, robotics, and cloud-native technologies must be technically accurate and aligned with current industry standards. This includes verifying that robotics concepts align with ROS2, URDF, and real control systems, and that agentic AI content reflects current production practices.

### III. Practical Outcomes
Every chapter must provide hands-on examples, practical implementations, and reproducible demonstrations that readers can follow. Each module should include working code examples, simulation exercises, or physical robot implementations that validate the theoretical concepts.

### IV. Ethical Responsibility
Development of AI and robotics content must emphasize safety, responsible AI practices, and ethical considerations. Content must include safety notes, ethical implications, and responsible deployment practices throughout all modules.

### V. Reproducible Content
All code examples, technical implementations, and demonstrations must be fully reproducible by readers. Content must be source-traceable with citations to official documentation or reputable research, avoiding hallucinations or unverifiable claims.

### VI. Open Scientific Communication
Research and development must prioritize reproducible results, open sharing of findings (where ethically appropriate), and clear documentation to advance the entire field of Physical AI and benefit humanity broadly.

## Educational Standards

All content must follow pedagogical best practices with clear learning objectives, structured examples, and progressive complexity. Each chapter must include objectives, examples, implementation steps, and a final exercise that validates student understanding. The tone must be mentor-to-student, respectful, and direct.

## Content Quality Requirements

Content must be original and source-traceable with official documentation or reputable research citations. Code examples must run successfully when implemented by students. All technical modules must include inputs, outputs, architecture descriptions, implementation code, failure modes, and safety notes to ensure comprehensive understanding.

## Technical Requirements

All robotics concepts must align with ROS2, URDF, and real control systems. Agentic AI content must reflect current production practices. Code examples must successfully execute in simulation or real-world deployments. All images and figures must include alt text for accessibility. Book must deploy to GitHub Pages with no build errors and all code must be reproducible.

## Project Scope & Constraints

The textbook must contain 20,000-35,000 words of original content with at least one working demonstration (simulation acceptable). All content must be implemented following specification-driven development practices, with each chapter starting from a formal specification document.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Amendments require documentation of rationale, approval by the core team, and explicit migration plans for existing content. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified through clear benefits to educational value, technical accuracy, or safety considerations.
