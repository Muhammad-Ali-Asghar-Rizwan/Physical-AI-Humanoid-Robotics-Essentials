## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

Requirements:
- Follow the Module 4 specification from /sp.specify exactly
- Adhere to Constitution principles from /sp.constitution
- Stay within the plan framework from /sp.plan
- Write in clear, educational prose with working code examples
- Build upon Modules 1, 2 & 3 knowledge (ROS 2 + Simulation + Perception)
- Include all sections defined in the specification
- Culminate in the Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid

Output format:
- Docusaurus-compatible markdown
- Proper headings hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Code blocks with language tags (bash, python, yaml, json)
- Internal links to previous modules where relevant
- Images/diagrams described in alt text
- API keys and security best practices

The module includes comprehensive coverage of VLA systems, from voice command recognition through LLM-based task planning to physical action execution. All code examples are syntactically correct and include expected commands and configurations for implementing VLA systems. The content builds upon previous modules (ROS 2, simulation, and perception) and culminates in the capstone project of an autonomous humanoid robot that can understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks.
