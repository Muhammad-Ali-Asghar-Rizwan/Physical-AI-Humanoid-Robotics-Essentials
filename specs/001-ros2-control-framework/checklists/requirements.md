# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: specs/001-ros2-control-framework/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [X] No unnecessary implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - NOTE: ROS 2 concepts are appropriate as core subject
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - 2 remaining (acceptable limit is 3) - RESOLVED in research.md
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are appropriately technology-specific (ROS 2 concepts are the subject)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] Appropriate implementation details included (ROS 2 concepts are the subject)

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- The 2 NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers are within the acceptable limit of 3
- Implementation details related to ROS 2 are appropriate since this is an educational module about ROS 2
